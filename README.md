# Penrose Config
## Michael Cooney

I'm planning to soon replace my Xmonad window manager with my own, written using
the Penrose library.  This is where it will be stored online, and where my progress
and previous states will be.  Feel free to take it if you want, but, of course,
please give me credit if you do.
